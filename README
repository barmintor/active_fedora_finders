ActiveFedora::Finders

A mixin to allow use of dynamic finder methods (a la Rails) with ActiveFedora.  These methods operate against the FCRepo Object Search.
Allowed fields are the 15 DCES metadata fields, and the FCRepo object properties, ie:

SINGLE_VALUE_FIELDS = [:pid, :cDate, :mDate, :label]
SYSTEM_FIELDS = SINGLE_VALUE_FIELDS.concat [:ownerId]
DC_FIELDS = [:contributor, :coverage, :creator, :date, :description, :format,
             :identifier, :language, :publisher, :relation, :rights, :source,
             :subject, :title, :type ]
SUPPORTED_ALTS = [:cdate, :create_date, :mdate, :modified_date, :owner_id]


Example:

class MyModel < ActiveFedora::Base
  include ActiveFedora::Finders
end

obj = MyModel.find_by_identifier("fedora-system:ContentModel-3.0")

Roadmap:

0.1: dynamic finders, bang support
0.2: support or_create|initialize
0.3: support _all and _last
0.4: support scopes
