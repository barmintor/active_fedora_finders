ActiveFedora::Finders

A mixin to allow use of dynamic finder methods (a la Rails) with ActiveFedora.  These methods operate against the FCRepo Object Search.
Allowed fields are the 15 DCES metadata fields, and the FCRepo object properties, ie:

SINGLE_VALUE_FIELDS = [:pid, :cDate, :mDate, :label]
SYSTEM_FIELDS = SINGLE_VALUE_FIELDS.concat [:ownerId]
DC_FIELDS = [:contributor, :coverage, :creator, :date, :description, :format,
             :identifier, :language, :publisher, :relation, :rights, :source,
             :subject, :title, :type ]
SUPPORTED_ALTS = [:cdate, :create_date, :mdate, :modified_date, :owner_id]


Example:

class MyModel < ActiveFedora::Base
  include ActiveFedora::RepositoryQuerying
end

obj = MyModel.search_repo(pid: "fedora-system:ContentModel-3.0").first!
